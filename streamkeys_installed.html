    <h1>A new version of Streamkeys has been installed!</h1>
    <h3>...This one works!</h3>
    <p>This is a major update that fixes the majority of the problems from the previous release. If this extension didn't work for you before ... try it again now! The hotkey presses are now captured more accurately and you will be able to control the players from anywhere in the Chrome browser. In addition, support for many new sites has been added. <br>If you still run into problems please send me an email: minilogo@gmail.com</p>

    <h1>New Default Hotkeys:</h1>
    <h3>Mac:</h3>
    <b>Play/Pause: </b>Alt + Shift + 2 <br>
    <b>Next Song: </b>Alt + Shift + 3 <br>
    <b>Previous Song: </b>Alt + Shift + 1 <br>
    <b>Mute: </b>Cmd + Shift + M <br>

    <h3>Windows:</h3>
    <b>Play/Pause: </b>Media Key Play<br>
    <b>Next Song: </b>Media Key Next<br>
    <b>Previous Song: </b>Media Key Previous<br>
    <b>Mute: </b>Cmd + Shift + M <br><br>

    <p><b>Note:</b> All hotkeys can be changed. Simply go to the chrome extensions tab (get there from Chrome menu -> tools -> extensions). At the bottom there is a button for "Keboard Shortcuts" where you can change the hotkeys to those of your choosing.</p>
    <p><b>Mac users:</b> Currently there is an issue with capturing media key presses in chrome on macs. This issue is slated to be fixed in the next Chrome release, but until then you will have to use other keys, sorry!
    <br><br>
    Thanks for using Streamkeys!<br>
    You can change these hotkeys to anything you like - on the chrome extension tab there is a link at the very bottom called "Keyboard shortcuts".
